# Placement Prediction using Machine Learning Model

## Introduction
In this project, we have developed a placement prediction model using machine learning techniques. The goal of this model is to predict the likelihood of a student being placed in a job based on various features such as academic performance, skills, and other relevant attributes.

## Model Development
We trained a Random Forest classifier using a dataset containing historical placement data of students. The dataset includes features such as:
- Academic performance (e.g., GPA, percentage)
- Internship experience
- Backlogs
- leetcode stats
- aptitude marks
- And more...

### Steps Taken:
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values
   - Encoded categorical variables
   - Split the data into training and testing sets

2. **Model Training**:
   - Utilized Random Forest algorithm for classification
   - Tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance
   - Trained the model on the training data

3. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Ensured the model generalizes well on unseen data

4. **Saving the Model**:
   - Saved the trained Random Forest model to a file for future use

5. **Saving the Scaler**:
   - Saved the scaler used for feature scaling to ensure consistency during prediction

## Deployment in a Website
To utilize the placement prediction model in a website for progress tracking and placement prediction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Model Integration**:
   - Load the saved Random Forest model and scaler in the web application backend.

2. **Feature Collection**:
   - Collect relevant information from the user such as academic performance, skills, internships, etc., through a user-friendly interface.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Preprocess the collected data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features using the saved scaler.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Use the preprocessed data as input to the loaded Random Forest model to predict the probability of placement.

5. **Display Results**:
   - Display the prediction result (placement probability) to the user.
   - Provide additional insights or recommendations based on the prediction result to guide the user's progress tracking and career decisions.

## Conclusion
By integrating the placement prediction model into a website, students can receive personalized guidance and insights regarding their placement prospects. This not only helps in progress tracking but also assists students in making informed decisions about their career paths.
